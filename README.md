## Gemstones Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the price of gemstones using various regression techniques. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and compare different regression models to accurately predict the price of gemstones based on their characteristics. The project involves the following key steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loading the dataset and performing initial data inspection.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates and outliers, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
3.  **Model Development:** Implementing and training several regression models, including:
    *   Linear Regression
    *   Polynomial Regression
    *   Ridge Regression
    *   Lasso Regression
    *   Gradient Boosting Regressor
4.  **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared score.
5.  **Model Comparison:** Analyzing and comparing the performance of the different models to identify the most effective approach.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `cubic_zirconia.csv`. It contains information about gemstones, including features like carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and dimensions (x, y, z), as well as the price.

# Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You will also need the following libraries:

*   pandas
*   numpy
*   scikit-learn
*   matplotlib

(You can install these libraries using pip)
